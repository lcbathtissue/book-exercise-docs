# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 03

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-03-001 - Lab Module 03](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-10488379).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

The CDA (Constrained Device Application) implementation focuses on simulating sensor data, packaging it, and enabling efficient data communication with the GDA (Gateway Device Application). It simulates sensor readings for humidity, pressure, and temperature, packages this data into telemetry objects, and can trigger simulated actuation based on predefined thresholds. Additionally, it now incorporates JSON serialization capabilities to convert telemetry objects into JSON format for seamless data exchange with the GDA. This ensures that data generated by the CDA can be easily transformed and transmitted to the GDA for further processing.

How does your implementation work?

The CDA uses Python and Object-Oriented design principles. Simulated sensors for humidity, pressure, and temperature generate synthetic sensor data periodically. TelemetryObjects are created to structure this data along with metadata like timestamps and device IDs. When threshold conditions are met, the CDA issues simulated actuator commands. The critical addition is the JSON serialization functionality, which converts telemetry objects into JSON format. This enables the CDA to prepare its data for transmission to the GDA. By implementing JSON serialization, the CDA ensures that its data can be efficiently shared with the GDA, facilitating data transformation and interoperability between the two components.

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

- ConstrainedDeviceAppTest
- SystemPerformanceManagerTest
- ActuatorDataTest
- BaseIotDataTest
- DataUtilTest
- SensorDataTest
- SystemPerformanceDataTest

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)

- ConfigUtilTest
- SystemCpuUtilTaskTest
- SystemMemUtilTaskTest
- DeviceDataManagerNoCommsTest
- DataIntegrationTest
- ActuatorEmulatorManagerTest
- HumidifierEmulatorTaskTest
- HumidityEmulatorTaskTest
- HvacEmulatorTaskTest
- LedDisplayEmulatorTaskTest
- PressureEmulatorTaskTest
- SenseHatEmulatorQuickTest
- SensorEmulatorManagerTest
- TemperatureEmulatorTaskTest
